-- Table Schema:
-- Table: npn_users
--   user_id: INT
--   user_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: npn_messages
--   message_id: INT
--   sender_id: INT
--   sent_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH daily_message_counts AS (
    SELECT
        DATE(m.sent_at) AS message_date,
        m.sender_id,
        COUNT(*) AS message_count
    FROM npn_messages m
    GROUP BY DATE(m.sent_at), m.sender_id
),
ranked_users AS (
    SELECT
        message_date,
        sender_id,
        message_count,
        RANK() OVER (
            PARTITION BY message_date
            ORDER BY message_count DESC
        ) AS rnk
    FROM daily_message_counts
)
SELECT
    r.message_date,
    u.user_name,
    r.message_count
FROM ranked_users r
JOIN npn_users u
    ON r.sender_id = u.user_id
WHERE r.rnk = 1;
